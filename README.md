# Othello in Java

This was a school assignment in the object-oriented programming course. I decided to push the boundaries of the assignment a bit and implement a 3D game interface for the fun of it!

**Features**:

* 3D view with different cameras
* Animations in 3D (i.e. jumping and flipping disks)
* Dynamic lighting

**Easter Egg**

There is an easter egg hidden in the game! It was put in as a friendly joke involving my professor. Can you find it!?
